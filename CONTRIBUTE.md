## Code Guidelines for Python

1. Testing: We use pytest for this project. We require that all previous tests pass and that your provide proper tests with your contribution.
2. MyPy: We use type annotations and mypy to check for proper type annotations and usage of types throughout the code.
3. Linting: We use flake8 with the configuration in .flake8.

## Code Guidelines for Rust

1. Testing: We use `cargo test` (in qoqo_mock/roqoqo_mock) for roqoqo_mock and `pytest ./tests` (in qoqo_mock/qoqo_mock) for qoqo_mock. We require that all previous tests pass and that your provide proper tests with your contribution.
2. Linting: We use `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` to lint all Rust code (qoqo_mock/roqoqo_mock), and `flake8 ./qoqo_mock`, `mypy ./qoqo_mock` to lint all Python code (qoqo_mock/qoqo_mock).
3. Formatting: We check formatting with `cargo fmt --all --check` in Rust code (qoqo_mock/roqoqo_mock), and with flake8 in Python code (qoqo_mock/qoqo_mock).
